One of my favorite books is the Handmaid's Tale, written by Margaret Atwood, and is presently a miniseries on HULU. Hulu's viewing 
audience is extremely excited about the miniseries and looks forward to the 5th season of the award-winning "Handmaid's Tale!"

Elizabeth Moss' rendition as June is right on! I liked the show's first 2 seasons!
